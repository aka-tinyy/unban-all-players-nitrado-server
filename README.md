Simple command to unban all players on a specified nitride server

This code may or may not work I do not have a server to test it, if it does not work open an issue and I will see if I can fix it. Just add your discord bot token and nitrado token in the ``bot.py`` file and you should be good. 

Only install needed is pycord

``pip install py-cord==2.0.0b5``
